**Learning-oriented guides for getting started with the ATT&CK Data Model**

Welcome to the tutorials section! These step-by-step guides will teach you how to work with the MITRE ATT&CKÂ® Data Model (ADM) from the ground up. Each tutorial is designed to be completed by anyone with basic TypeScript knowledge, regardless of their familiarity with ATT&CK.

## What You'll Learn

These tutorials will take you from zero knowledge to confidently using the ATT&CK Data Model in your applications:

1. **[Your First ATT&CK Query](./your-first-query)** - Learn the basics of loading and exploring ATT&CK data
2. **[Building a Technique Browser](./technique-browser)** - Create a complete application that browses ATT&CK techniques
3. **[Understanding ATT&CK Relationships](./relationships)** - Master navigation between related ATT&CK objects

## Tutorial Philosophy

These tutorials follow a hands-on approach where you'll learn by doing:

- **Step-by-step progression**: Each tutorial builds on the previous one
- **Complete examples**: All code examples are tested and working
- **Immediate results**: Every step produces visible outcomes
- **Beginner-friendly**: No prior ATT&CK knowledge assumed
