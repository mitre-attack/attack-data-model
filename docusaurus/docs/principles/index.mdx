# Guiding Principles

<WorkInProgressNotice />

**Understanding-oriented content about design decisions and architecture**

This section explores the "why" behind the ATT&CK Data Model - the design decisions, architectural choices, and trade-offs that shape the library.
These explanations provide context and rationale rather than instructions, helping you understand the deeper principles that guide the project.

## Dive Deeper

### Foundational Context

- **[Why the ATT&CK Data Model Exists](./why-adm-exists)** - The problem context, solution approach, and value proposition
- **[Why Zod Instead of X](./why-zod)** - Why we chose Zod over other options
- **[STIX 2.1 as the Foundation](./stix-foundation)** - Why STIX was chosen and how it shapes the architecture

### ATT&CK Specification Understanding

- **[ATT&CK Specification Overview](./attack-specification-overview)** - Understanding the structure and purpose of the ATT&CK specification
- **[Object Design Rationale](./object-design-rationale)** - Why ATT&CK objects are structured the way they are
- **[Versioning Philosophy](./versioning-philosophy)** - Understanding ATT&CK's multi-dimensional versioning approach

### Technical Architecture

- **[Schema Design Principles](./schema-design)** - Validation philosophy, refinement patterns, and extensibility choices

### Miscellaneous

- **[Compatibility](./compatibility)** - Compatibility matrix of versions of ATT&CK, the data model, and the library
- **[Architecture & Design Trade-offs](./trade-offs)** - Reasons why architecture decisions were made
