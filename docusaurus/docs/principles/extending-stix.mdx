# Extending STIX

<WorkInProgressNotice />

There are three general ways that ATT&CK extends the STIX 2.1 specification:

1. **Custom Object Types**: Prefixed with `x-mitre-`, e.g `x-mitre-matrix`.
2. **Custom Fields**: Prefixed with `x_mitre_`, e.g `x_mitre_platforms` in `attack-patterns`.
3. **New Relationship Types**: Not prefixed with `x_mitre_`.

For more information on how STIX is customizable, here is the STIX documentation on customizing STIX ([STIX 2.0](https://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/stix/v2.0/cs01/part1-stix-core/stix-v2.0-cs01-part1-stix-core.html#_Toc496709308), [STIX 2.1](https://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/stix/v2.1/os/stix-v2.1-os.html#_p2sz1mp7z524)).
While it is deprecated, ATT&CK currently uses the STIX 2.0 method of extending STIX, which is valid even in STIX 2.1 bundles.
We have aspirations to create [STIX 2.1 Extension Definitions](https://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/stix/v2.1/os/stix-v2.1-os.html#_32j232tfvtly)
one day and hope to include them in future ATT&CK versions.

## Custom Object Types

Object types prefixed with `x-mitre-`, e.g `x-mitre-matrix`, are custom STIX types extending the STIX 2.1 specification.
They follow the general STIX Domain Object pattern
([STIX 2.0](https://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/stix/v2.0/csprd01/part2-stix-objects/stix-v2.0-csprd01-part2-stix-objects.html#_Toc476230920), [STIX 2.1](https://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/stix/v2.1/os/stix-v2.1-os.html#_nrhq5e9nylke))
but describe concepts not covered by types defined in STIX 2.1.

## Custom Fields

Custom MITRE ATT&CK properties may exist on ATT&CK object's (custom or otherwise).
Such fields are prefixed with `x_mitre_`, e.g `x_mitre_platforms` in `attack-patterns`.
The following extended fields are common across ATT&CK types except where otherwise noted:

| Field                                     | Type     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| :---------------------------------------- | :------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `x_mitre_version`<sup>1</sup>             | string   | The version of the object in format `major.minor` where `major` and `minor` are integers. ATT&CK increments this version number when the object content is updated. This is not included on `relationship` objects.                                                                                         |
| `x_mitre_contributors`                    | string[] | People and organizations who have contributed to the object.<br />Not found on objects of type `relationship`.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `x_mitre_modified_by_ref`                 | string   | The STIX ID of an `identity` object. Used to track the identity of the individual or organization which created the current _version_ of the object. Previous versions of the object may have been created by other individuals or organizations.                                                           |
| `x_mitre_domains`                         | string[] | Identifies the domains the object is found in. See [domains](#domains) for more information.<br />Not found on objects of type `relationship`, `identity`, or `marking-definition`.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `x_mitre_attack_spec_version`<sup>1</sup> | string   | The version of the ATT&CK specification used by the object. Consuming software can use this field to determine if the data format is supported. Current version is 3.3.0. |

## New relationship types

Unlike custom object types and extended fields, custom relationship types are **not** prefixed with `x_mitre_`. You can find a full list of relationship types in the [Relationships](#relationships) section, which also mentions whether the type is a default STIX type.
