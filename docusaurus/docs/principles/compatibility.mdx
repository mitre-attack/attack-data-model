# Compatibility

<WorkInProgressNotice />

This page tracks the compatibility between versions of the ATT&CK® Data Model (ADM) TypeScript API (`@mitre-attack/attack-data-model`), the ATT&CK® Specification, and versions of the MITRE ATT&CK® dataset (`mitre-attack/attack-stix-data`).

<sup>1</sup>Other versions of ATT&CK or the ATT&CK Specification may work with the specified ADM release, but are not officially supported.
## Compatibility Details

- **ATT&CK Specification v3.3.0**:
  - **Features**:
    - Introduces support for three new SDOs:
      - MITRE Detection Strategies (`x-mitre-detection-strategy`) <sup>[[schema](../src/schemas/sdo/detection-strategy.schema.ts)]</sup>
      - MITRE Analytics (`x-mitre-analytic`) <sup>[[schema](../src/schemas/sdo/analytic.schema.ts)]</sup>
      - MITRE Log Sources (`x-mitre-log-sources`) <sup>[[schema](../src/schemas/sdo/log-source.schema.ts)]</sup>
    - MITRE Data Sources (`x-mitre-data-sources`) <sup>[[schema](../src/schemas/sdo/data-source.schema.ts)]</sup> are _deprecated_ and will be removed in ATT&CK Specification v4.0.0
    - Supports all content introduced in ATT&CK Release v18.x and earlier, including new techniques, tactics, and relationships.
  - **Notes**:
    - Ensure that you are using the correct domain (e.g., `enterprise-attack`, `mobile-attack`) when loading data to avoid inconsistencies.
    - The ADM's Zod schemas and TypeScript types are aligned with the ATT&CK Specification v4.0.0, providing a codified expression of the specification.

## Using Other Versions

While the ADM may function with other versions of the ATT&CK dataset or ATT&CK Specification, the following considerations apply:

- **Older ATT&CK Releases**: May lack properties or objects that the ADM expects based on the latest ATT&CK Specification, potentially causing validation errors or missing data when parsing.
- **Newer ATT&CK Releases**: May introduce new objects or properties not recognized by the current ADM version, leading to incomplete data mapping or parsing failures.
- **Different ATT&CK Specification Versions**: Using a different specification version may result in discrepancies between the expected and actual data model, affecting validation and data integrity.

## Recommendations

- **Stay Updated**: Always use the ADM version that corresponds to the ATT&CK Specification and dataset version you are working with.
- **Check `ATTACK_SPEC_VERSION`**: Refer to the `ATTACK_SPEC_VERSION` file in the repository to identify the ATT&CK Specification version the ADM is pinned to.
- **Testing**: If you need to use unsupported versions, thoroughly test your application to ensure data integrity.
- **Feedback**: If you require support for additional ATT&CK versions or specifications, consider opening an issue or contributing to the project.

## Future Compatibility Plans

We plan to:

- **Regular Updates**: Release new ADM versions shortly after new ATT&CK Specifications or ATT&CK dataset versions are published.
- **Backward Compatibility**: Where feasible, maintain backward compatibility with previous ATT&CK Specifications and releases.
- **Deprecation Notices**: Provide deprecation warnings in documentation and release notes when dropping support for older versions.
