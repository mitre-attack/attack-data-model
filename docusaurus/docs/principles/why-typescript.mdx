# Why TypeScript Instead of X

<WorkInProgressNotice />

Q: Many of our users primarily use Python, so why did we choose to create a TypeScript-based data model?

A: We chose TypeScript because it filled a need we had to manage multiple websites such as the
[ATT&CK Navigator](https://github.com/mitre-attack/attack-navigator),
[ATT&CK Workbench](https://github.com/center-for-threat-informed-defense/attack-workbench-frontend),
and a future redesigned ATT&CK website.
These websites all parse the ATT&CK STIX bundles with the same logic spread out across different codebases.
By consolidating the logic into a single TypeScript-based data model, we can ensure consistency and reduce the risk of errors.

Q: Are you going to create a Python-based data model as well?

A: While we have a TypeScript-based data model, we are also working on a Python-based data model to better serve our users who primarily use Python.
This will allow for seamless integration and usage within the Python ecosystem.
[Zod](./why-zod.mdx) has the functionality to export as a JSON Schema ([link](https://zod.dev/json-schema)),
which we hope to use to create a Python-based data model,
likely using Pydantic with its [datamodel-code-generator](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/integrations/datamodel_code_generator/).

Q: When will the Python-based data model be available?

A: We are working on it and hope to have it available in the near future!
However, our priority at the moment is to get all the rough edges smoothed out with the website components mentioned above first
so we can ensure a stable and reliable foundation for the Python-based data model.
