# Why Zod Instead of X

<WorkInProgressNotice />

## JSON Schema

- **Context**: Need for runtime validation and TypeScript integration
- **Decision**: Use Zod for schema definition
- **Alternatives Considered**: JSON Schema, Pydantic (when we were considering using Python)

**Rationale**:

- Zod provides TypeScript type inference automatically
- Runtime validation matches compile-time types exactly
- Schema definitions are more maintainable in TypeScript
- Better error messages for developers

**Trade-offs**:

- Zod is less universally known than JSON Schema
- Schemas are tied to TypeScript ecosystem
- Larger runtime bundle due to Zod dependency
