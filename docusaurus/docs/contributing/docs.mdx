# Documentation

This covers how we generate the documentation for the ATT&CK Data Model.

All of these commands are run from the `docusaurus/` directory, so be sure to run this first.
Otherwise you may be very confused as to why these commands don't exist in the top-level `package.json`!

```bash
cd docusaurus/

# don't forget to install the dependencies that are specific to building the documentation
npm install
```

## Auto-generating schema reference files

The script `generate-docs.sh` introspects **all** `*.schema.ts` files and
emits Markdown to `docusaurus/docs/reference/schemas/*` which is git ignored.

```bash
npm run gendocs
```

## Run the documentation site locally

Running one of the following commands will enable you to open the site locally at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

```bash
# opens your default browser automatically
npm start

# doesn't open your browser
npm run -- --no-open
```

## Adding new how-to guides

Its pretty easy to add a new guide. Basically just do the following:

1. Create your Markdown file inside `docusaurus/docs/<topic>/my-guide.md`
2. Update `sidebars.ts` to include it
