# Documentation

This covers how we generate the documentation for the ATT&CK Data Model.

All of these commands are run from the `docusaurus/` directory, so be sure to run this first.
Otherwise you may be very confused as to why these commands don't exist in the top-level `package.json`!

### Requirements
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v18.20
- [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) v3.5

### Install dependences

```bash
cd docusaurus/

# don't forget to install the dependencies that are specific to building the documentation
$ npm install
```

## Auto-generating schema reference files

The `generate-docs.sh` script is used to automate the process of converting Zod schemas into Markdown. 

The script introspects **all** `*.schema.ts` files and emits Markdown to `docusaurus/docs/reference/schemas/*` which is git ignored.

This is the only commamd that should be run from the repository root directory.

```bash
cd ..
npm run docs:schemamarkdown
```

## Local Development

The following command will start a local development server and open a browser window. Most changes will
be reflected live without needing to restart the server.

```bash
$ npm run start
```

## Deployment

1. Build the static files

    ```bash
    $ npm run build
    ```

2. Serve contents

    ```bash
    $ npm run serve
    ```

## Taging a new version

The following command will create a new version of the specified set of documentation (e.g. `schemas` or `api`) from its respective "current version" files. 

```bash
$ npm run docusaurus docs:version:<pluginId> <new_version>
```

For example, to tag a new version of the `schemas` or `api` docs:

```bash
# Tag schemas doc version 4.4.1
$ npm run docusaurus docs:version:api 4.4.1

# Tag schemas doc version 3.3.0
$ npm run docusaurus docs:version:schemas: 3.3.0
```

### Versioned Docs Multi-Instance File Structure

The default plugin instance, `docs`, contains our global docs content and is unversioned uses these paths:

The `schemas` and `api` plugin instances use these paths:
- `docusaurus/[pluginId]/` - Current Version docs folder
- `docusaurus/sidebars[pluginId].ts` - Current Version sidebar
- `docusaurus/[pluginId]_versions.json` - Lists other versions
- `docusaurus/[pluginId]_versioned_docs/` - Contains other versions docs folders
- `docusaurus/[pluginId]_versioned_sidebars/` - Contains other versions sidebars

## Troubleshooting

To clear the site's generated assets, caches, and build artifacts:
```bash
$ npm run clear
```

Deployment using SSH:
```bash
$ USE_SSH=true yarn deploy
```

Deployment without SSH:
```bash
$ GIT_USER=<Your GitHub username> yarn deploy
```

## Adding new how-to guides

Its pretty easy to add a new guide. Basically just do the following:

1. Create your Markdown file inside `docusaurus/docs/<topic>/my-guide.md`
2. Update `sidebars.ts` to include it
