# ATT&CK IDs

<WorkInProgressNotice />

ATT&CK objects use multiple identifier systems to support different use cases and ensure compatibility with external frameworks.

## STIX IDs

Every ATT&CK object (including relationships) contains a STIX ID in its `id` field.
STIX IDs are guaranteed to be globally unique and follow the STIX 2.1 specification format.

**STIX IDs are the recommended method for programmatic object retrieval and referencing.**

## ATT&CK IDs

ATT&CK IDs are human-readable identifiers commonly used for referencing objects in documentation and communication. Each ATT&CK object type follows a specific ID format:

| ATT&CK concept                              | ID format                               |
| :------------------------------------------ | :-------------------------------------- |
| [Matrix](#matrices)                         | [domain identifier](#domain-membership) |
| [Tactic](#tactics)                          | `TAxxxx`                                |
| [Technique](#techniques)                    | `Txxxx`                                 |
| [Sub-Technique](#sub-techniques)            | `Txxxx.yyy`                             |
| [Mitigation](#mitigations)                  | `Mxxxx`                                 |
| [Group](#groups)                            | `Gxxxx`                                 |
| [Software](#software)                       | `Sxxxx`                                 |
| [Data Source](#data-sources)                | `DSxxxx`                                |
| [Data Component](#data-components)          | `DCxxxx`                                |
| [Campaign](#campaigns)                      | `Cxxxx`                                 |
| [Asset](#assets)                            | `Axxxx`                                 |
| [Detection Strategy](#detection-strategies) | `DETxxxx`                               |
| [Analytic](#analytics)                      | `ANxxxx`                                |
| [Log Source](#log-sources)                  | `LSxxxx`                                |

**Important limitations:**

- ATT&CK IDs are not guaranteed to be unique (see [Collisions with Technique ATT&CK IDs](#collisions-with-technique-attck-ids))
- Matrices within the same domain share identical ATT&CK IDs
- Relationship objects do not have ATT&CK IDs

ATT&CK IDs are stored in the first external reference of applicable objects, which also includes a `url` field linking to the object's page on the [ATT&CK Website](https://attack.mitre.org/).
