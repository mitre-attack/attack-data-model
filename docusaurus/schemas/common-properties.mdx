## Domain Membership

The `x_mitre_domains` (string array) field identifies the "domain" to which the object belongs. The values of `x_mitre_domains` are as follows:

| identifier          | domain         |
| :------------------ | :------------- |
| `enterprise-attack` | Enterprise     |
| `mobile-attack`     | Mobile         |
| `ics-attack`        | ICS            |

Most objects in ATT&CK belong in a single technology domain, but an object _may_ be included in multiple domains.

`x_mitre_domains` is supported on all ATT&CK object types except the following:

- Marking Definition
- Identity
- Relationship
